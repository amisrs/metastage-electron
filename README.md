# Metastage

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6.

This app treats one directory as a "stage" and all the tilemaps within that directory will be part of the stage. Arrange the tilemaps as you like and save and it'll output a .json file with the positions and crossings between tilemaps. Currently only reads json tilemaps generated by Tiled.
